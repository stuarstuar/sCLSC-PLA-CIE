This repository has as main objective to provide the relevant data, source code and results of the deterministic and two-stage stochastic MILP models presented in:
"Design of a closed-loop Supply Chain for the Production and Composting of Polylactic Acid (PLA): a multi-objective stochastic programming approach" (submitted to Computers & Industrial Engineering).

Results are generated by running two notebooks.

Results for the deterministic model (reported in Table 6 of the manuscript) are generated by:
"CLSC-PLA DETERMINISTIC (F).ipynb"

Results for the two-stage stochastic model (reported in Table 6 of the manuscript) are generated by:
"CLSC-PLA STOCHASTIC (F).ipynb"

Data (monetary and non-monetary) was generated following the distributions described in Tables 4 and 5 of the manuscript and represented through N scenarios. It corresponds to:

- Client demand
- Supplier demand
- Raw material reception capacity
- Return reception capacity
- Raw material availability
- Supplier–location distances and location–client distances
- Investment costs for polymerization and composting facilities
- Raw material acquisition costs
- PLA selling price and compost selling price

The optimization models are implemented in Pyomo and solved using GLPK.
